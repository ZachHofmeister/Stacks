# Stacks

Stacks is a simple budgeting app for iOS.

Stacks lets you record your current account balances and income, and create spending categories, called "stacks", to organize your money. "Stacks" can be a percentage of your income, accruing over time such as monthly bills, or can be simple ledgers of expenses and allowances.

It is designed to be customizable to fit the way you want to budget and help you track what you're spending on.
