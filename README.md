# ðŸ’µ Stacks ðŸ’µ

Stacks is a simple budgeting app for iOS. I started building it because organizing and restructuing my Google Sheets budget was getting tedious and I wanted to see if I could develop an app that would give me as much flexibility as my spreadsheet but in a prettier, more structured way. I finished the basic features in a month or so, and I've been happily using it ever since. I've added and tweaked some things since then and still have lots of feature in mind that I'm working on too. 

## Features
Stacks lets you record your current account balances and income, and create spending categories, called "stacks", to organize your money. "Stacks" can be a percentage of your income, accruing over time such as monthly bills, or can be simple ledgers of expenses and allowances.

It is designed to be customizable to fit the way you want to budget and help you track what you're spending on.
